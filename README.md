### **Line-by-Line Explanation**

The optical system is defined as a collection of assemblies and standalone surfaces, in the order of appearance in the optical train. First, assemblies are defined here. You can define an assembly now and rotate/place it later in the optical train section. In an assembly, the surfaces within are defined with relative positioning to the assembly's local coordinate system.

#### **Assemblies Section - Cassegrain Telescope**
```yaml
assemblies:
  - aid: 0                       # Assembly ID 0 for the Cassegrain telescope
    #1600 mm cassegrain          # Comment: This is a 1600mm focal length telescope
    m1:                          # Primary mirror (M1) - the large concave mirror
      {relative: 0, normal: [-1,0,0], shape: spherical, radius: -834.78, semidia: 100, mode: reflection}
```
**Primary Mirror (m1) Parameters:**
- `relative: 0` - Position at assembly origin (0mm from assembly center)
- `normal: [-1,0,0]` - Surface normal points in -X direction (left)
- `shape: spherical` - Standard spherical mirror surface
- `radius: -834.78` - Radius of curvature in mm (negative = concave surface)
- `semidia: 100` - Semi-diameter in mm (aperture radius = 100mm, diameter = 200mm)
- `mode: reflection` - Mirror surface (reflects light)

```yaml
    m2:                          # Secondary mirror (M2) - the small convex mirror
      {relative: -300, normal: [1,0,0],  shape: spherical, radius: 317.65,  semidia: 30,  mode: reflection}
```
**Secondary Mirror (m2) Parameters:**
- `relative: -300` - Position 300mm in front of primary mirror (-300mm along assembly X-axis)
- `normal: [1,0,0]` - Surface normal points in +X direction (right, towards primary)
- `shape: spherical` - Standard spherical mirror surface
- `radius: 317.65` - Radius of curvature in mm (positive = convex surface)
- `semidia: 30` - Semi-diameter in mm (aperture radius = 30mm, diameter = 60mm)
- `mode: reflection` - Mirror surface (reflects light)

In this Cassegrain example, you see how telescope optics are defined. The **relative** term specifies position relative to the previous surface - it can be a single number (X-axis only) or a 3-element list [X,Y,Z] for full 3D positioning. Notice how the secondary mirror (m2) has `relative: -300`, placing it 300mm in front of the primary mirror. Of course, the rays we are interested first interact with primary, then secondary mirror, so we define m1 primary then m2 secondary just like any sequential model, despite the fact that secondary is in the front.

The **normal** of each surface defines which direction the surface faces, assuming the assembly is aligned with the X-axis. In Cassegrain telescopes, the secondary mirror points backwards (`normal: [1,0,0]`) toward the primary mirror to reflect light back through the central hole. You can also use `angles: [azimuth, elevation]` instead of normal vectors.

The **shape** term defines surface geometry - "spherical" creates curved surfaces with specified radius, "plano" creates flat surfaces, with additional options for "aspherical" and "cylindrical" shapes.

The **mode** term sets optical behavior:
- **partial** - Surface both reflects and transmits light with configurable transmission coefficient (beam splitter)
- **aperture** - Only rays that intersect with aperture are allowed to pass uninterrupted; those that don't make the cut are blocked from subsequent surfaces
- **diffuse** - Surface scatters light with random Gaussian distribution toward next surface

*Note: Some parameters use default values when not explicitly stated.*

## Chapter 3: Additional Tutorials & Advanced Examples

### **Tutorial 2: Light Sources - Multiple Ray Patterns**

![Light Sources Tutorial](examples/Lights%20tutorial.png)

The light sources example (`examples/light_sources.yml`) demonstrates the four different ray pattern types available in Simple Ray Tracer. This tutorial shows how to create and position multiple light sources with different characteristics.

**Key Learning Points:**
- **Multiple Light Sources**: How to define several light sources in one system
- **Ray Pattern Types**: Ring, linear, uniform, and point source patterns
- **Direction Specification**: Using both `vector: [x,y,z]` and `angles: [azimuth,elevation]` formats
- **Wavelength Control**: Different colors (488nm blue, 532nm green, 589nm yellow, 633nm red)
- **Ray Density**: Controlling the number of rays per source for performance vs quality

**Example Setup:**
```yaml
light_sources:
  - ring:      # Circular ring pattern at 488nm (blue)
      {lid: 0, position: [0,-5,-5], vector: [1,0,0], number: 25, wavelength: 488, type: ring, param: [10,0.5,30]}
  - linear:    # Linear array at 532nm (green) using angles
      {lid: 1, position: [0,-5,5], angles: [90,-45], number: 5, wavelength: 532, type: linear, param: [10,45]}
  - uniform:   # Uniform circular distribution at 589nm (yellow)
      {lid: 2, position: [0,15,-5], vector: [1,1,1], number: 25, wavelength: 589, type: uniform, param: 5}
  - point:     # Point source with divergence at 633nm (red)
      {lid: 3, position: [-10,5,5], vector: [-1,0,1], number: 25, wavelength: 633, type: point, param: 0.2}
```

This example is perfect for understanding how different light sources create distinct ray patterns and how wavelength affects visualization with color-coded rays.

### **Tutorial 3: Amici Prism - Relative Positioning & Dial Rotation**

![Amici Prism Tutorial](examples/Amici%20tutorial.png)

The Amici prism example (`examples/amici.yml`) demonstrates advanced surface positioning using relative coordinates and dial rotation. This tutorial showcases how to build complex optical assemblies where surfaces are positioned relative to each other.

**Key Learning Points:**
- **Relative Positioning**: Using `relative: [x,y,z]` for surface placement within assemblies
- **Dial Rotation**: Using `dial: angle` to rotate surfaces around their normal vectors
- **Complex Surface Normals**: Non-axis-aligned surface orientations like `[-0.7071,-1,-0.7071]`
- **Assembly Coordination**: How multiple surfaces work together in a single assembly
- **Prism Optics**: Total internal reflection and refraction through angled surfaces

**Key Surface Definitions:**
```yaml
assemblies:
  - aid: 0
    s1:  # Entrance surface
      {relative: [0,0,5], shape: plano, height: 60, width: 50, mode: refraction, n2: 1.517}
    s2:  # First reflection surface with dial rotation
      {relative: [24.99999,12.5,-5], shape: plano, height: 70.71068, width: 35.35534, 
       mode: reflection, normal: [-0.7071,-1,-0.7071], dial: 35.25}
    s3:  # Second reflection surface with opposite dial
      {relative: [0, -25,0], shape: plano, height: 70.71068, width: 35.35534, 
       mode: reflection, normal: [-0.7071,1,-0.7071], dial: -35.25}
```

**Assembly Positioning with Dial:**
```yaml
optical_trains:
  - a: {lid: 0}    # Light source
    b: {aid: 0, position: [20,0,0], angles: [0,0], dial: 30}  # Rotated assembly
```

This example demonstrates how `dial` rotation affects the entire assembly orientation, and how `relative` positioning creates precise geometric relationships between surfaces within the assembly.
