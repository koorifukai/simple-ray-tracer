## Chapter 2: How to Use - Three Optical System Tutorials

### **Tutorial 1: Cassegrain Telescope - Basic System Structure**

![Cassegrain Telescope Ray Tracing](Cassegrain%20tutorial.png)

The Cassegrain telescope example (`examples/cassegrain.yml`) demonstrates fundamental optical system structure with assemblies, surfaces, light sources, and optical trains.

**Key Learning Points:**
- **Assembly Structure**: How to group related surfaces (primary/secondary mirrors)
- **Surface Parameters**: Understanding radius, semidia, and optical modes
- **Beam Splitting**: Creating dual-path optical systems
- **Global Positioning**: Placing assemblies in 3D space
- **Basic YAML Structure**: Complete system definition format

**Key Components:**
```yaml
assemblies:
  - aid: 0  # Cassegrain telescope
    m1: {relative: 0, normal: [-1,0,0], shape: spherical, radius: -834.78, semidia: 100, mode: reflection}
    m2: {relative: -300, normal: [1,0,0], shape: spherical, radius: 317.65, semidia: 30, mode: reflection}
  - aid: 1  # Beam splitter  
    s1: {relative: 0, normal: [-1,0,0], shape: plano, height: 30, width: 30, mode: partial, transmission: 0.5, n2: 1.5}

light_sources:
  - l1: {lid: 0, position: [0,5,0], vector: [1,0,0], number: 25, wavelength: 488, type: ring, param: 80}

optical_trains:
  - light: {lid: 0}
    cassegrain: {aid: 0, position: [350,0,0], normal: [-1,0,0]}
    beam_spliter: {aid: 1, position: [400,0,0], normal: [-1,0,1]}
    detector_1: {sid: 0, position: [475,0,0], normal: [-1,0,0]}
    detector_2: {sid: 1, position: [400,0,75], normal: [0,0,-1]}
```

This example teaches basic system architecture: how assemblies group surfaces, how optical trains define light paths, and how beam splitters create multiple detection paths.

### **Tutorial 2: Light Sources - Multiple Ray Patterns**

![Light Sources Tutorial](Lights%20tutorial.png)

The light sources example (`examples/light_sources.yml`) demonstrates the four different ray pattern types available in Simple Ray Tracer. This tutorial shows how to create and position multiple light sources with different characteristics.

**Key Learning Points:**
- **Multiple Light Sources**: How to define several light sources in one system
- **Ray Pattern Types**: Ring, linear, uniform, and point source patterns
- **Direction Specification**: Using both `vector: [x,y,z]` and `angles: [azimuth,elevation]` formats
- **Wavelength Control**: Different colors (488nm blue, 532nm green, 589nm yellow, 633nm red)
- **Ray Density**: Controlling the number of rays per source for performance vs quality

**Example Setup:**
```yaml
light_sources:
  - ring:      # Circular ring pattern at 488nm (blue). Param contains radius, aspect ratio, rotation
      {lid: 0, position: [0,-5,-5], vector: [1,0,0], number: 25, wavelength: 488, type: ring, param: [10,0.5,30]}
  - linear:    # Linear array at 532nm (green) using angles. Param contains width, rotation
      {lid: 1, position: [0,-5,5], angles: [90,-45], number: 5, wavelength: 532, type: linear, param: [10,45]}
  - uniform:   # Uniform circular distribution at 589nm (yellow). Param contains radius
      {lid: 2, position: [0,15,-5], vector: [1,1,1], number: 25, wavelength: 589, type: uniform, param: 5}
  - point:     # Point source with divergence at 633nm (red). Param contains half-angle divergence (radian)
      {lid: 3, position: [-10,5,5], vector: [-1,0,1], number: 25, wavelength: 633, type: point, param: 0.2}
```

This example is perfect for understanding how different light sources create distinct ray patterns and how wavelength affects visualization with color-coded rays.

### **Tutorial 3: Amici Prism - Relative Positioning & Dial Rotation**

![Amici Prism Tutorial](Amici%20tutorial.png)

The Amici prism example (`examples/amici.yml`) demonstrates advanced surface positioning using relative coordinates and dial rotation. This tutorial showcases how to build complex optical assemblies where surfaces are positioned relative to each other.

**Key Learning Points:**
- **Relative Positioning**: Using `relative: [x,y,z]` for surface placement within assemblies
- **Dial Rotation**: Using `dial: angle` to rotate surfaces around their normal vectors
- **Complex Surface Normals**: Non-axis-aligned surface orientations like `[-0.7071,-1,-0.7071]`
- **Assembly Coordination**: How multiple surfaces work together in a single assembly
- **Prism Optics**: Total internal reflection and refraction through angled surfaces

**Key Surface Definitions:**
```yaml
assemblies:
  - aid: 0
    s1:  # Entrance surface
      {relative: [0,0,5], shape: plano, height: 60, width: 50, mode: refraction, n2: 1.517}
    s2:  # First reflection surface with dial rotation
      {relative: [24.99999,12.5,-5], shape: plano, height: 70.71068, width: 35.35534, 
       mode: reflection, normal: [-0.7071,-1,-0.7071], dial: 35.25}
    s3:  # Second reflection surface with opposite dial
      {relative: [0, -25,0], shape: plano, height: 70.71068, width: 35.35534, 
       mode: reflection, normal: [-0.7071,1,-0.7071], dial: -35.25}
```

**Assembly Positioning with Dial:**
```yaml
optical_trains:
  - a: {lid: 0}    # Light source
    b: {aid: 0, position: [20,0,0], angles: [0,0], dial: 30}  # Rotated assembly
```

This example demonstrates how `dial` rotation affects the entire assembly orientation, and how `relative` positioning creates precise geometric relationships between surfaces within the assembly.
