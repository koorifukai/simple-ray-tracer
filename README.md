## Testing Methodology

This project uses **Ground Truth Validation** - comparing implementation output against a proven reference program:

### Console Testing (Primary)
```bash
npm run test                 # Full ground truth validation
npm run test:ground-truth    # Same as above
```

Console tests are the **primary validation method**. They:
- Parse test cases from `src/tests/SurfaceTests.yml`
- Compare output against expected results in `src/tests/SurfaceTests.txt`
- Use ¬±1e-4 numerical tolerance for all comparisons
- Provide detailed failure analysis with exact mismatch values
- **Strict One-to-One Corner Matching**: Requires exactly 4 calculated corners to match exactly 4 expected corners (no partial matches allowed)
- **Enhanced Plane Geometry Validation**: Verifies that all 6 edge vectors connecting 4 corners are perpendicular to surface normal AND that all corners lie on the same plane (coplanarity test)

### Browser Testing (Secondary)
```bash
npm run test:browser        # Opens browser for visual inspection
```

Browser tests are only used **after console tests pass** for visual verification.

### Test Cases

The ground truth validation covers 8 test surfaces with:
- Surface definitions using both `normal: [x,y,z]` and `angles: [azimuth,elevation]`
- Dial rotations combined with surface orientations
- Assembly positioning with complex coordinate transforms
- Various optical train configurations

## YAML System Format

```yaml

## Current Development Status

‚úÖ **Ground Truth Validation Complete**: All 16 surfaces across 2 test suites pass validation with ¬±1e-4 numerical precision.

‚úÖ **Visualization Corner Accuracy Fixed**: Surface mesh generation now uses identical dial rotation methodology as test validation, ensuring rendered surfaces exactly match calculated corners.

**Recent Achievement**: Successfully resolved dial rotation coordinate system bug through systematic investigation:
- **Problem**: Dial rotation worked only for surface normal [-1,0,0], failed for other orientations
- **Root Cause**: Incorrect application of dial rotation to coordinate transformation matrix instead of position-to-corner vectors  
- **Solution**: Implemented proper Rodrigues rotation methodology - transform corners without dial, then rotate position-to-corner vectors around world normal
- **Validation**: Mathematical verification confirmed Rodrigues formula correctness; issue was coordinate system application
- **Lesson**: Demonstrates importance of systematic investigation over rushed conclusions

**Visualization Enhancement**: Fixed mesh generation to match test validation corner calculation:
- **Problem**: Visualization used post-dial transform matrix while test validation correctly separated dial rotation
- **Root Cause**: `SurfaceRenderer.generatePlanarMesh` applied dial rotation via transform matrix instead of Rodrigues rotation
- **Solution**: Updated both circular and rectangular mesh generation to use same Rodrigues rotation methodology as test validation
- **Verification**: Debug script confirmed perfect corner correspondence (0.000e+0 difference) between mesh generation and test validation
- **Impact**: Rendered optical surfaces now accurately represent the mathematically correct corner positions

**Test Coverage**: 
- Surface positioning and normal calculations: ‚úÖ 100% accuracy
- Dial rotation mechanics: ‚úÖ 100% accuracy  
- Assembly coordinate transforms: ‚úÖ 100% accuracy
- Corner generation geometry: ‚úÖ 100% accuracy

The project demonstrates robust optical engineering mathematics with comprehensive validation against reference implementation.

## üîß Debugging Guide: Browser vs Terminal Coordinate Mismatch

### Problem Identification
If you encounter a situation where:
- ‚úÖ Terminal validation tests pass perfectly
- ‚ùå Browser visualization shows incorrect surface positions/rotations
- üîç Console shows coordinates that don't match terminal calculations

### Root Cause Analysis Framework

**Step 1: Check for Old Compiled JavaScript Files**
```bash
# Look for stale .js files that might be shadowing .ts files
find src/ -name "*.js" -type f
```

**Critical Files to Check:**
- `src/optical/surfaces.js` (shadows `surfaces.ts`)
- `src/math/Matrix4.js` (shadows `Matrix4.ts`) 
- `src/math/Vector3.js` (shadows `Vector3.ts`)

**Step 2: Enable Comprehensive Debug Logging**
The codebase includes detailed PLOT VISUALIZATION OPERATIONS logging:

```typescript
// In surfaces.ts - Assembly processing pipeline
console.log('=== PLOT VISUALIZATION OPERATIONS START ===');
// ... detailed assembly transformation logging

// In SurfaceRenderer.generatePlanarMesh - Mesh generation
console.log('--- PLOT VISUALIZATION OPERATIONS: Corner X Mesh Generation ---');
// ... step-by-step coordinate transformation logging
```

**Step 3: Compare Browser vs Terminal Coordinates**
Use the debug scripts to validate terminal calculations:
```bash
node debug-dial-comparison.ts  # Terminal coordinate validation
```

Then check browser console for PLOT VISUALIZATION OPERATIONS logs to compare.

### Solution: Remove Stale JavaScript Files

**Problem**: Vite can load old compiled `.js` files instead of updated `.ts` files, causing the browser to use outdated coordinate calculation logic.

**Solution**:
```bash
# Remove old compiled JavaScript files to force Vite to use TypeScript
Remove-Item "src\optical\surfaces.js" -Force
Remove-Item "src\math\Matrix4.js" -Force  
Remove-Item "src\math\Vector3.js" -Force
```

**Verification**: After removal, refresh browser and check that:
1. PLOT VISUALIZATION OPERATIONS logs appear in console
2. Calculated coordinates match terminal validation exactly
3. Visualization displays correctly

### üìã Recent Case Study (December 2024)

**Issue**: Browser showed s2 corner 1 at `[34.724391, -4.891644, -58.190121]` while terminal validation calculated `[5.761732, 25.325679, -57.019363]`

**Investigation Process**:
1. ‚úÖ Added comprehensive assembly operation logging
2. ‚úÖ Enhanced mesh generation step-by-step debugging  
3. ‚úÖ Confirmed terminal validation was correct
4. üîç Discovered browser was using `surfaces.js` instead of `surfaces.ts`
5. ‚úÖ Removed stale JavaScript files
6. ‚úÖ Browser coordinates immediately matched terminal: `[5.761732, 25.325679, -57.019363]`

**Key Lesson**: Always check for stale compiled files when browser behavior doesn't match terminal validation, especially after significant TypeScript updates.

**Prevention**: The debug logging infrastructure now provides immediate visibility into coordinate calculation discrepancies, making future issues easier to diagnose.
